            <p> Hi! My name is Nicholas Jap and I am currently a sophmore at Dublin high school. 
                I want to be an engineer who builds and designs things that will make people's lives
                easier and better.  I love helping other people out and becoming an engineer is something
                that inspires me to be something more. I plan to explore the engineering department and
                grow/learn everything it means to be an engineer.  I am interested in this field because
                I want to make a difference and use my creative thinking to design something amazing.<br></br>
                Some of the key skills that good engineers have, is being determined and hardworking.
                I am always determined to finish a task no matter how hard it is. Whenever I'm running,
                my legs may feel limp or out of energy but if I can see the finish line, I push through
                the pain and get past that line. I also showed determination as I never give up or lose
                hope, even during the bleakest situations. There are times when I could have stopped and
                just give in but I persevere in these moments like when I am losing in a chess match but
                I come back in the end to win. I am also hardworking because during group projects I
                contribute my very best and do all the work I am assigned and sometimes more. During work
                time, I am always striving to get a lot of work done and not get distracted by outside
                influences by focusing. This is my second year at Dublin High and I have been given the
                oppurtunity to participate in club activities like GiveLight and Magic Club. In these 
                clubs, I learn ways I can benefit the community through doing simple magic for the ones
                in need or doing community service and helping the open kitchen. Additionally, I have 
                also volunteered in the ESPCA Animal shelter and this experience has taught me how to 
                manage and work in a habitat enviroment. Outside of high school, I have gotten various 
                awards for piano and 1st place in my first chess tournament. Being in the clubs like 
                chess, I have learned how to be patient and think ahead. In chess, being able to remain
                patient and always think one step ahead is crucial to winning the match.<br></br> I have
                also taken an engineering club back in 7th grade and this experience allowed me to
                understand basic coding and how to work with a team. During this club, I learned python
                coding and how to use a raspberry pi. Later on that year, we did a project where we built
                a race car and designed a code to make it move in all directions. This was a group project
                and the experience taught me how to work with a group and take the time to learn all the
                qualities of what it meant to be a team. Additionally, I also learned how to think outside
                the box and listen. When I'm coding, usually the basic solutions aren't always the right ones.
                So, through this, I learned how to think critically and outside the box. I think overall, I
                am a well-rounded student who is always looking forward to new things and exploring new fields
                and someone whose learning how to be a better student but more importantly a better person.
                Thank you for reading and enjoy the rest of my site!
