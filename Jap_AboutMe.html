                Hi! My name is Nicholas Jap and I am currently a sophomore at Dublin High School. 
                I want to be an engineer who can design products that will make people's lives
                easier. I love helping other people and becoming an engineer is something that
                will allow me to reach the people in need. I plan to explore the engineering department and
                learn everything it means to be an engineer.  I am interested in this field because
                I want to make a difference and use my creativity to design something that will be 
                impactful for the world.<br></br>
                Some of the key skills that engineers have include being determined and hardworking.
                I am always determined to finish a task no matter how hard it is. I am also always
                determined as I never give up or lose hope, even during the bleakest situations. 
                There are times when I could have stopped and just give in but I persevere in these
                moments. When I am losing in a chess match, I don't give up until the end and sometimes
                I end up coming back to win. I am also hard working because during group projects I
                contribute my very best and do more than I am assigned. When we get time to work
                I am always striving to get a lot of work done and focus upon the given task. 
                This is my second year at Dublin High and I have been given the opportunity to 
                participate in club activities like GiveLight and Magic Club. In these clubs, I learn
                ways I can benefit the community through doing simple magic for the ones in need or 
                doing community service and helping the open kitchen. Additionally, I have also 
                volunteered in the East Bay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals(SPCA)
                shelter and this experience has taught me how to manage and work in a habitat environment.
                Outside of school, I have gotten various awards for piano and also managed to get 1st
                place in my first chess tournament. Being in clubs like chess, I have learned how to
                be patient and think ahead. In chess, being able to remain patient and being able to
                think one step ahead is crucial to winning the match.<br></br> 
                I have also taken an engineering club back in 7th grade and this experience allowed
                me to understand basic coding and how to work with a team. I learned the basics of python
                and how to use a raspberry pi. Later on that year, we did a project where we built
                a race car and coded it to make it move in all directions. This was a group project
                and this project taught me how to work as a team. Additionally, I also learned how to 
                think outside the box and listen to my team. I think overall, I am a well-rounded 
                student who is always looking forward to new things and exploring new fields. I am 
                someone who is learning how to be a better student but more importantly a better person.
                Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of my site!
