            <p>In this project, our objective was to implement new features to a certain game design with the features of app inventor. Me and my partner chose the Mole Mash game and added bonus features to make the game more intruging such as 
                additional point system, a life system, and others. In this project I primarily worked on the documentation and some of the coding and comments of the game. In this project I learned how hard it is to find the exact right code that
                that will get everything to work right away. Additionally, this experience taught me the importance of teamwork and communication as a team. Some challenges we had to overcome was the various bugs in our game. In the end we were
                able to resolve some of the major ones. Overall the project went well and was pretty fun to do.</p>
