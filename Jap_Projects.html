            <p>In this project, our objective was to implement new features to a certain game design using app inventor. My partner and I chose the Mole Mash game and added bonus features to make the game more intriguing such as 
                an additional point system, a life system, and other improvements. Additionally, we were able to get many useful feedback from our peers during the gallery walk. We worked on fixing these problems during our workdays. In this project 
                I primarily worked on the documentation, some of the coding, and comments of the game. In this project I learned how hard it is to find the exact right code that
                that will get everything to work in the right way we want it to. Additionally, this experience taught me the importance of teamwork and communication as a team. Some challenges we had to overcome was the various bugs in our game such
                as the mole overlapping each other. We worked hard to resolve this issue and in the end we were able to resolve some of the major bugs. Overall the project went well and provided good experience in the game design area</p>
