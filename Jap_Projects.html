            <p>In this project, our objective was to implement new features to a certain game design using App Inventor. My partner and I chose the Mole Mash game and added bonus features to make the game more intriguing such as 
                an additional point system, a life system, and other improvements. Additionally, we were able to get useful feedback from our peers during the gallery walk. We worked on fixing these problems during our workdays. In this project 
                I primarily worked on the documentation, some of the coding, and comments of the game. In this project I learned how hard it is to find the exact right code thatwill get everything to work in the right way we want
                it to. Additionally, this experience taught me the importance of teamwork and communication as a team. Some challenges we had to overcome were the various bugs in our game such
                as the mole overlapping each other. We worked hard to resolve this issue and in the end we were able to resolve some of the major bugs. Overall the project went well and provided good experience in the game design area.</p>

            <p>In this project my partner and I worked on creating a game with user interaction
            in which the user is able to choose the storyline and how they want the game to go.
            In this project I worked on the storyline aspect of the game as well as creating the conditional statement
            for the mini game we had in the end. I learned that making a story line with the given conditions
            can be hard but it can also be fun. Along the way I learned more on how to make a working story type game
            while also making it interactive and fun for the user. Some challenges we faced along the way was getting the conditional
            statements to work on the rock paper scissor game because there were many bugs we encountered while making this.
            Me and my partner worked well to plan out how we wanted our story to go and thne brainstormed the different routes 
            we could possibly make for each scene. Additionally we distributed the workload evenly and both of us got our part done on 
            time. The project went well overall and we were able to make the type of story game we wanted.</p>
